<h1><strong>MacWall - Realtime Firewall&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>This project is in beta. I was looking for a firewall for my Mac Pro . Alot great ones out there, Although&nbsp; I rather be in the terminal if possible. Claude and I turned out this Real Time Firewall that does not ( should not ) need any pre&nbsp;prerequisites.</p>
<p>Some features , such as real time Risk scoring and threat assessment and Detailed intelligence logging via Mac OSx and Linux terminal.</p>
<p><strong> &bull; Port Scanning Detection and monitorying </strong></p>
<p><strong>&bull;Hostname resolution for suspicious IPs </strong></p>
<p><strong>&bull; WHOIS and geolocation lookup </strong></p>
<p><strong>&bull; VPN/Proxy detection </strong></p>
<p><strong>&bull; ARP spoofing detection and monitoring </strong></p>
<p><strong>&bull; Gateway integrity verification </strong></p>
<p><strong>&bull; MAC address conflict detection </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Much more to come. This is collab with Cladue :-D I wish I could take credit , But I cannot . </strong></p>
