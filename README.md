<h1><strong>MacWall - Realtime üî•Firewallüß±&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>This project is in beta. I was looking for a firewall for my Mac Pro . Alot great ones out there, Although&nbsp; I rather be in the terminal if possible. Claude and I turned out this Real Time Firewall that does not ( should not ) need any pre&nbsp;prerequisites.</p>
<p>Some features , such as real time Risk scoring and threat assessment and Detailed intelligence logging via Mac OSx and Linux terminal.</p>

<h3>** Recent updates ** </h3>

<b>Macwall monitoring script with a comprehensive file integrity checking system! Here are the key additions:</b>

üåê Network Security (original functionality)
üõ°Ô∏è ARP Spoofing Protection
üîí File System Integrity (new addition)

Usage: The script will automatically create baselines on first run and begin monitoring. Any tampering with critical files will be immediately detected and logged with detailed change information! Run with: sudo chmod +x Macwall.sh &amp;&amp; ./Macwall.sh . 


üîí New File Integrity Features Added:

Configuration Variables

ENABLE_FILE_INTEGRITY=true - Master switch for file integrity monitoring
INTEGRITY_CHECK_INTERVAL=5 - Checks files every N monitoring cycles (reduces overhead)
Dedicated log file: $HOME/file_integrity.log
Baseline storage directory: $HOME/.macwall_baselines

Critical Files Being Monitored
System Security Files:

/etc/passwd, /etc/sudoers, /etc/hosts
/etc/ssh/sshd_config, /etc/ssh/ssh_config
/etc/shells, /etc/resolv.conf
System launch daemons and authorization files

User-Specific Files:

~/.ssh/authorized_keys, ~/.ssh/config
Shell profiles (.bashrc, .zshrc, .profile)

Application Credentials:

~/.aws/credentials, ~/.docker/config.json
~/.netrc and other credential files

<h2>Detection Capabilities</h2>
<p>
‚úÖ MD5 Checksum Verification - Detects content tampering

  ‚úÖ Modification Time Tracking - Identifies when files changed

‚úÖ Permission/Ownership Changes - Detects privilege escalation

‚úÖ File Deletion Detection - Alerts when critical files disappear

‚úÖ Recent Activity Monitoring - Finds suspicious recent changes

‚úÖ Risk-Based Alerting - HIGH risk for auth files, MEDIUM for others
</p>
<h2>Key Functions Added</h2>

initialize_file_integrity() - Creates baseline checksums on first run

check_file_integrity() - Compares current state vs baseline

detect_suspicious_modifications() - Finds recently changed critical files

show_file_integrity_status() - Displays monitoring status

<h2>Smart Features</h2>

Baseline Auto-Update: Non-critical files get updated baselines automatically

Critical File Protection: Security files (passwd, sudoers, SSH keys) require manual investigation

Performance Optimized: Only checks files every N cycles to reduce system load

Comprehensive Logging: Detailed violation logs with timestamps and change details
